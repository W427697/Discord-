title: 'Feature support for frameworks'
---

Storybook integrates with many popular frontend frameworks. We do our best to keep feature parity amongst frameworks, but it’s tricky for our modest team to support every framework.

Below is a comprehensive table of what’s supported in which framework integration. If you’d like a certain feature supported in your framework, we welcome pull requests.

## Core frameworks

Core frameworks have dedicated maintainers or contributors who are responsible for maintaining the integration. As such, you can use most Storybook features in these frameworks.

## Community frameworks

Community frameworks have fewer contributors which means they may not be as up to date as core frameworks. If you use one of these frameworks for your job, please consider contributing to its integration with Storybook.

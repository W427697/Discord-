title: 'Story rendering'
---

In Storybook, your stories render in a particular “preview” iframe (also called the Canvas) inside the larger Storybook web application. The JavaScript build configuration of the preview is controlled by a [builder](../builders/index.md) config, but you also may want to run some code for every story or directly control the rendered HTML to help your stories render correctly.

## Running code for every story

Code executed in the preview file (`.storybook/preview.js|ts`) runs for every story in your Storybook. This is useful for setting up global styles, initializing libraries, or anything else required to render your components.

<If notRenderer={['angular', 'vue']}>
  Here's an example of how you might use the preview file to initialize a library that must run before your components render:

  ```ts
  // .storybook/preview.ts
  // Replace your-renderer with the renderer you are using (e.g., react, vue3)
  import { Preview } from '@storybook/your-renderer';

  import { initialize } from '../lib/your-library';

  initialize();

  const preview: Preview = {
    // ...
  };

  export default preview;
  ```
</If>

<If renderer={['angular', 'vue']}>
  For example, with Vue, you can extend Storybook's application and register your library (e.g., [Fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome)). Or with Angular, add the package ([localize](https://angular.io/api/localize)) into your `polyfills.ts` and import it:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-with-library-decorator.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}
</If>

## Adding to \<head>

If you need to add extra elements to the `head` of the preview iframe, for instance, to load static stylesheets, font files, or similar, you can create a file called [`.storybook/preview-head.html`](./index.md#configure-story-rendering) and add tags like this:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-head-example.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Callout variant="info">
  Storybook will inject these tags into the *preview iframe* where your components render, not the Storybook application UI.
</Callout>

However, it's also possible to modify the preview head HTML programmatically using a preset defined in the `main.js` file. Read the [presets documentation](../addons/writing-presets.md#ui-configuration) for more information.

## Adding to \<body>

Sometimes, you may need to add different tags to the `<body>`. Helpful for adding some custom content roots.

You can accomplish this by creating a file called `preview-body.html` inside your `.storybook` directory and adding tags like this:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-body-example.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

If using relative sizing in your project (like `rem` or `em`), you may update the base `font-size` by adding a `style` tag to `preview-body.html`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-body-font-size.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Callout variant="info">
  Storybook will inject these tags into the *preview iframe* where your components render, not the Storybook application UI.
</Callout>

Just like how you have the ability to customize the preview `head` HTML tag, you can also follow the same steps to customize the preview `body` with a preset. To obtain more information on how to do this, refer to the [presets documentation](../addons/writing-presets.md#ui-configuration).

## Major breaking changes

The rest of this guide will help you upgrade successfully, either automatically or manually. But first, there are some [breaking changes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#from-version-7x-to-800) in Storybook 8. Here are the most impactful changes you should know about before you go further:

* [`storiesOf` API has been removed](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#removal-of-storiesof-api)
* [`*.stories.mdx` format has been removed](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#dropping-support-for-storiesmdx-csf-in-mdx-format-and-mdx1-support)
* [Implicit actions (from `argTypesRegex`) can no longer be used during rendering (e.g. in a play function)](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#implicit-actions-can-not-be-used-during-rendering-for-example-in-the-play-function)
* [`react-docgen` (instead of `react-docgen-typescript`) is the default for component analysis](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#react-docgen-component-analysis-by-default)
* [Storyshots has been removed](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#storyshots-has-been-removed)

  * [Yarn 1 is no longer supported](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#dropping-support-for-yarn-1)

If any of these changes apply to your project, please read through the linked migration notes before continuing.

If any of these new requirements or changes are blockers for your project, we recommend to continue using Storybook 7.x.

You may wish to read the [full migration notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#from-version-7x-to-800) before migrating. Or you can follow the instructions below and we‚Äôll try to take care of everything for you!

## Automatic upgrade

To upgrade your Storybook:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This will:

1. Determine that none of the [breaking changes](#major-breaking-changes) apply to your project
   * If they do, you will receive instructions on how to resolve them before continuing
2. Upgrade your Storybook dependencies to the latest version
3. Run a collection of *automigrations*, which will:
   * Check for common upgrade tasks
   * Explain the necessary changes with links to more information
   * Ask for approval, then perform the task on your behalf

### Common upgrade issues

While we'll do our best to upgrade your project automatically, there is one issue worth mentioning that you might encounter during the upgrade process:

#### `storyStoreV7:false` and `storiesOf`

If you have `storyStoreV7: false` in your `.storybook/main.js`, you will need to remove it before you're able to upgrade to Storybook 8.

If you are using the `storiesOf` API (which requires `storyStoreV7: false` in Storybook 7), you will need to either [migrate your stories to CSF](../../release-7-6/docs/migration-guide.md#storiesof-to-csf) or use the [new indexer API to continue creating stories dynamically](../../release-7-6/docs/migration-guide.md#storiesof-to-dynamically-created-stories).

#### Missing `vite.config.js` file

If you are using Vite, you may now need to create a `vite.config.js` file in your project root to allow newer versions of Vite to work with Storybook. Additionally, you may need to install and configure a Vite plugin for your framework. More information is available in the [full migration notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#framework-specific-vite-plugins-have-to-be-explicitly-added).

## New projects

To add Storybook to a project that isn‚Äôt currently using Storybook:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This will:

1. Figure out which renderer (React, Vue, Angular, Web Components), builder (Webpack, Vite), or meta-framework (Next.js, SvelteKit) you‚Äôre using
2. Install Storybook 8 and auto-configure it to mirror project settings

## Manual migrations

In addition to the automated upgrades above, there are manual migrations that might be required to get Storybook 8 working in your project. We‚Äôve tried to minimize this list to make it easier to upgrade. These include:

### `*.stories.mdx` to MDX+CSF

Storybook now requires that MDX pages reference stories written in CSF, rather than the previous `.stories.mdx` hybrid approach. You can automatically convert your files using the following codemod (make sure to update the glob to fit your files):

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-migrate-mdx-to-csf.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

You‚Äôll also need to update your stories glob in `.storybook/main.js` to include the newly created .mdx and .stories.js files if it doesn‚Äôt already.

#### Known limitations

* The codemod does not remove the extracted stories from the `.stories.mdx` files. You will need to do this manually.

**Note:** this migration supports the Storybook 6 ["CSF stories with MDX docs"](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/6e19f0fe426d58f0f7981a42c3d0b0384fab49b1/code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-mdx-docs) recipe.

## Troubleshooting

The automatic upgrade should get your Storybook into a working state. If you encounter an error running Storybook after upgrading, here‚Äôs what to do:

1. Try running the [`doctor` command](../api/cli-options.md#doctor) to check for common issues (such as duplicate dependencies, incompatible addons, or mismatched versions) and see suggestions for fixing them.
2. If you‚Äôre running `storybook` with the `dev` command, try using the `build` command instead. Sometimes `build` errors are more legible than `dev` errors!
3. Check [the full migration notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#from-version-7x-to-800), which contains an exhaustive list of noteworthy changes in Storybook 8. Many of these are already handled by automigrations when you upgrade, but not all are. It‚Äôs also possible that you‚Äôre experiencing a corner case that we‚Äôre not aware of.
4. Search [Storybook issues on GitHub](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues). If you‚Äôre seeing a problem, there‚Äôs a good chance other people are too. If so, upvote the issue, try out any workarounds described in the comments, and comment back if you have useful info to contribute.
5. If there‚Äôs no existing issue, you can [file one](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/new/choose), ideally with a reproduction attached. We‚Äôll be on top of Storybook 8 issues as we‚Äôre stabilizing the release.

If you prefer to debug yourself, here are a few useful things you can do to help narrow down the problem:

1. Try removing all addons that are not in the `@storybook` npm namespace (make sure you don't remove the `storybook` package). Community addons that work well with 7.x might not yet be compatible with 8.0, and this is the fastest way to isolate that possibility. If you find an addon that needs to be upgraded to work with Storybook 8, please post an issue on the addon‚Äôs repository, or better yet, a pull request to upgrade it!
2. Another debugging technique is to bisect to older prerelease versions of Storybook to figure out which release broke your Storybook. For example, assuming that the current prerelease of Storybook is `8.0.0-beta.56`, you could set the version to `8.0.0-alpha.0` in your `package.json` and reinstall to verify that it still works (`alpha.0` should be nearly identical to `7.6.x`). If it works, you could then try `8.0.0-beta.0`, then `8.0.0-beta.28` and so forth. Once you‚Äôve isolated the bad release, read through its [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md) entry and perhaps there‚Äôs a change that jumps out as the culprit. If you find the problem, please submit an issue or pull request to the Storybook monorepo and we‚Äôll do our best to take care of it quickly.

## Optional migrations

In addition to the automigrations and manual migrations above, there are also optional migrations that you should consider. These are features that we‚Äôve deprecated in Storybook 8 (but remain backwards compatible), or best practices that should help you be more productive in the future.

### CSF 2 to CSF 3

There are [many good reasons](/blog/storybook-csf3-is-here/) to convert your stories from CSF 2 to CSF 3. We provide a codemod which, in most cases, should automatically make the code changes for you (make sure to update the glob to fit your files):

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-migrate-csf-2-to-3.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

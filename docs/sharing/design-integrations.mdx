Storybook integrates with design tools to speed up your development workflow. That helps you debug inconsistencies earlier in the design process, discover existing components to reuse, and compare designs to stories.

## Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a collaborative UI design tool that allows multiple people to work on the same design simultaneously in the browser. There are two ways to integrate Storybook and Figma.

### Embed Storybook in Figma with the plugin

[Storybook Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect) is a Figma plugin that allows you to embed component stories in Figma. Itâ€™s powered by [Storybook embeds](./embed.md) and [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website\&utm_medium=link\&utm_campaign=storybook), a publishing tool created by the Storybook team.

#### Install plugin

Before we begin, you must have a Storybook [published to Chromatic](./publish-storybook.md#publish-storybook-with-chromatic). It provides the index, versions, and access control that back the plugin.

Go to [Storybook Connect](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect) to install the plugin.

In Figma, open the command palette (in Mac OS, use `Command + /`, in Windows use `Control + /`) and type `Storybook Connect` to enable it.

![Figma palette Storybook connect](./figma-plugin-open-in-figma.png)

Follow the instructions to connect and authenticate with Chromatic.

#### Link stories to Figma components

Link stories to Figma components, variants, and instances.

Go to a story in a Storybook published on Chromatic. Make sure itâ€™s on the branch you want to link. Then copy the URL to the story.

In Figma, select the component, open the plugin, and paste the URL.

![Story linked in Figma](./figma-plugin-paste-url.png)

Chromatic will automatically update your linked stories to reflect the most recent Storybook published on the branch you linked. That means the link persists even as you push new code.

#### View stories in Figma

Once they're connected, you'll be able to view the story by clicking the link in the sidebar. Click "View story". Alternatively, open the plugin by using the command palette (in Mac OS, use `Command + /`, in Windows, use `Control + /`), then type `Storybook Connect`.

### Embed Figma in Storybook with the addon

[Designs addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-designs) allows you to embed Figma files and prototypes in Storybook.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-main-figma-addon-register.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

#### Link Figma components to stories

In Figma, open the file you want to embed in Storybook. You can embed files, prototypes, components, and frames.

* Embed a file or prototype, click the "Share" button to generate a unique URL for the file then click "Copy link".

* Embed a component or frame check "Link to selected frame" in the Share dialog. Or right click on the frame and go to "Copy/Paste as" Â» "Copy link".

In Storybook, add a new [parameter](../writing-stories/parameters.md) named `design` to your story and paste the Figma URL. For example:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-figma-integration.md" usesCsf3 csf2Path="sharing/design-integrations#snippet-component-story-figma-integration" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

#### View designs in Storybook

title: Storybook for Web components & Webpack
---

Storybook for Web components & Webpack is a [framework](../contribute/framework.md) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for applications using [Web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) built with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

<If notRenderer='web-components'>
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Web components & Webpack is only supported in [Web components](?renderer=web-components) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer='web-components'>
  ## Requirements

  * Webpack ≥ 5.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Web components project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](../_assets/get-started/install.md)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/web-components-webpack5`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="web-components-webpack5-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Next, install and register your appropriate compiler addon, depending on whether you're using SWC (recommended) or Babel:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-swc-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  or

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-compiler-babel-auto-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  More details can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../builders/webpack.md#compiler-support).

  Finally, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="web-components-webpack5-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## Hot Module Reloading (HMR)

  Web components are registered on global registry, which only accepts a given name/class once. That can lead to errors when using classical HMR. While there are ideas on how to achieve HMR with a static registry, there is no proven solution yet. Therefore, the best approach for now is to do full page reloads while developing. You can ensure those page reloads happen quickly by defining your stories as specific states of components (which we would recommend regardless).

  ## Set up es6/7 dependencies

  By default, Storybook only works with precompiled ES5 code. Because most web components themselves and their libs are distributed as ES2017, you will need to manually mark those packages as "needs transpilation".

  For example, if you have a library called `my-library` which is in ES2017, then you can configure your project like so:

  ```js
  // .storybook/main.js

  export default {
    webpackFinal: async (config) => {
      // Find web-components rule for extra transpilation
      const webComponentsRule = config.module.rules.find(
        (rule) => rule.use && rule.use.options && rule.use.options.babelrc === false
      );
      // Add your own `my-library`
      webComponentsRule.test.push(new RegExp(`node_modules(\\/|\\\\)my-library(.*)\\.js$`));

      return config;
    },
  };
  ```

  By default, the following folders are transpiled:

  * `src/*.js`
  * `packages/*/src/*.js`
  * `node_modules/lit-html/*.js`
  * `node_modules/lit-element/*.js`
  * `node_modules/@open-wc/*.js`
  * `node_modules/@polymer/*.js`
  * `node_modules/@vaadin/*.js`

  <Callout variant="info">
    Note that the `src` folder is also included. This provides some extra configuration to allow for `import.meta` and some other features.

    If you use a folder for your components/stories other than `src`, you will need to use the configuration example above to have it properly transpiled.
  </Callout>

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  ```js
  // .storybook/main.js
  import * as path from 'path';

  export default {
    // ...
    framework: {
      name: '@storybook/web-components-webpack5',
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  The available options are:

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../api/main-config-framework.md#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Webpack builder docs](../builders/webpack.md).

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Error while developing with HMR

  While developing a component, you might encounter this error:

  ```sh
  Failed to execute 'define' on 'CustomElementRegistry': the name "..." has already been used with this registry
  ```

  This error occurs because the component is already registered in the global registry. See the [limitations of HMR with web components](#hot-module-reloading-hmr) for more information.

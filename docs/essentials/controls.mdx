Storybook Controls gives you a graphical UI to interact with a component's arguments dynamically without needing to code. It creates an addon panel next to your component examples ("stories"), so you can edit them live.

</video>

Controls do not require any modification to your components. Stories for controls are:

* Convenient. Auto-generate controls based on React/Vue/Angular/etc. components.
* Portable. Reuse your interactive stories in documentation, tests, and even in designs.
* Rich. Customize the controls and interactive data to suit your exact needs.

To use the Controls addon, you need to write your stories using [args](../writing-stories/args.md). Storybook will automatically generate UI controls based on your args and what it can infer about your component. Still, you can configure the controls further using [argTypes](../api/arg-types.md), see below.

<Callout variant="info" icon="ðŸ’¡">
  If you have stories in the older pre-Storybook 6 style, check the [args & controls migration guide](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-6-migration-guide-200346241bb5) to learn how to convert your existing stories for args.

## Choosing the control type

<IfRenderer renderer="angular">
  By default, Storybook will try to infer the required argTypes and associated controls for your stories based on the component's definition and initial value of the args using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/), a documentation generator for Angular applications that can extract the metadata of your components, including first-class support for Angular's `inputs`, `outputs`, `properties`, `methods`, and `view/content child/children`. If you opt-in to use it, you must take additional steps to set it up properly.

  Run the following command to install the tooling.

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="compodoc-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Update your `angular.json` file to include the following configuration to include it in the Storybook's inbuilt builder configuration.

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="angular-project-compodoc-config.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Finally, update your `.storybook/preview.ts` file to include the following configuration to import the metadata generated by Compodoc and use it to generate the controls and argTypes for your stories.

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-compodoc-config.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  When you set the `component` annotation of the default export of your story file, it will be used to infer the controls and auto-generate the matching [`argTypes`](../api/arg-types.md) for your component.

<IfRenderer renderer="ember">
  By default, Storybook will try to infer the required argTypes and associated controls for your stories based on the metadata provided by the [`@storybook/ember-cli-storybook`](https://github.com/storybookjs/ember-cli-storybook) adapter.

  Update your `ember-cli-build.js` configuration file to include the adapter.

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-ember-cli-build.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Restart your application to generate the metadata file (i.e., `storybook-docgen/index.json`) and update your `.storybook/preview.js` file to include it, which will be used to create the controls and argTypes for your stories.

    If you're using a framework that doesn't support this feature, you'll need to define the `argTypes` for your component [manually](#fully-custom-args).
  </Callout>
</IfRenderer>

For instance, suppose you have a `variant` arg on your story that should be `primary` or `secondary`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="button-story-controls-primary-variant.md" usesCsf3 csf2Path="essentials/controls#snippet-button-story-controls-primary-variant" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

By default, Storybook will render a free text input for the `variant` arg:

![Essential addon Controls using a string](addon-controls-args-variant-string.png)

It works as long as you type a valid string into the auto-generated text control. Still, it's not the best UI for our scenario, given that the component only accepts `primary` or `secondary` as variants. Letâ€™s replace it with Storybookâ€™s radio component.

We can specify which controls get used by declaring a custom [argType](../api/arg-types.md) for the `variant` property. ArgTypes encode basic metadata for args, such as name, description, and defaultValue for an arg. These get automatically filled in by Storybook Docs.

`ArgTypes` can also contain arbitrary annotations, which the user can override. Since `variant` is a property of the component, let's put that annotation on the default export.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="button-story-controls-radio-group.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Callout variant="info" icon="ðŸ’¡">
  ArgTypes are a powerful feature that can be used to customize the controls for your stories. For more information, see the documentation about [customizing controls](#annotation) with `argTypes` annotation.
</Callout>

This replaces the input with a radio group for a more intuitive experience.

![Essential Control addon with a radio group](addon-controls-args-variant-optimized.png)

## Custom control type matchers

Controls can automatically be inferred from arg's name with [regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), but currently only for the color picker and date picker controls. If you've used the Storybook CLI to setup your project, it should have automatically created the following defaults in `.storybook/preview.js`:

| Control   | Default regex                            | Description                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **color** | <code>/(background|color)$/i</code> | Will display a color picker UI for the args that match it |
| **date**  | `/Date$/`                                | Will display a date picker UI for the args that match it  |

If you haven't used the CLI to set the configuration, or if you want to define your patterns, use the `matchers` property in the `controls` parameter:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-addon-controls-custom-matchers.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<IfRenderer renderer={['angular', 'ember', 'html', 'preact', 'qwik', 'react', 'solid', 'vue', 'web-components' ]}>
  {/* Uncomment once frameworks that support custom templates are enabled to prevent misinformation about the example */}

  ## Fully custom args

  Until now, we only used auto-generated controls based on the component for which we're writing stories. If we are writing [complex stories](../writing-stories/stories-for-multiple-components.md), we may want to add controls for args that arenâ€™t part of the component. For example, here's how you could use a `footer` arg to populate a child component:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="page-story-slots.md" usesCsf3 csf2Path="writing-stories/args#snippet-page-story-slots" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  By default, Storybook will add controls for all args that:

  * It infers from the component definition [if your framework supports it](../configure/frameworks-feature-support.md).

  * Appear in the list of args for your story.

  Using `argTypes`, you can change the display and behavior of each control.
</IfRenderer>

### Dealing with complex values

When dealing with non-primitive values, you'll notice that you'll run into some limitations. The most obvious issue is that not every value can be represented as part of the `args` param in the URL, losing the ability to share and deep link to such a state. Beyond that, complex values such as JSX cannot be synchronized between the manager (e.g., Controls addon) and the preview (your story).

One way to deal with this is to use primitive values (e.g., strings) as arg values and add a custom `render` function to convert them to their complex counterpart before rendering. It isn't the nicest way to do it (see below), but certainly the most flexible.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-custom-args-complex.md" usesCsf3 csf2Path="essentials/controls#snippet-component-story-custom-args-complex" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Unless you need the flexibility of a function, an easier way to map primitives to complex values before rendering is to define a `mapping`; additionally, you can specify `control.labels` to configure custom labels for your checkbox, radio, or select input.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-custom-args-mapping.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Note that both `mapping` and `control.labels` don't have to be exhaustive. If the currently selected option is not listed, it's used verbatim.

## Creating and editing stories from controls

The Controls addon allows you to create or edit stories, directly from the Controls panel.

### Create a new story

Open the Controls panel for a story and adjust the value of a control. Then save those changes as a new story.

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source src="../get-started/new-story-from-controls-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<If renderer="react">
  If you're working on a component that does not yet have any stories, you can click the âž• button in the sidebar to search for your component and have a basic story created for you.

  <video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
    <source src="../get-started/new-component-story-from-plus-button-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</If>

### Edit a story

You can also update a control's value, then save the changes to the story. The story file's code will be updated for you.

</video>

## Configuration

The Controls addon can be configured in two ways:

* Individual controls can be configured via control annotations.
* The addon's appearance can be configured via parameters.

### Annotation

As shown above, you can configure individual controls with the â€œcontrol" annotation in the [argTypes](../api/arg-types.md) field of either a component or story. Below is a condensed example and table featuring all available controls.

| Data Type   | Control        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|             | `file`         | Provides a file input component that returns an array of URLs.<br /> Can be further customized to accept specific file types.<br /> `argTypes: { avatar: { control: { type: 'file', accept: '.png' } }}`                    |
| **enum**    | `radio`        | Provides a set of radio buttons based on the available options.<br /> `argTypes: { contact: { control: 'radio', options: ['email', 'phone', 'mail'] }}`                                                                    |

|             | `check`        | Provides a set of checkbox components for selecting multiple options.<br /> `argTypes: { contact: { control: 'check', options: ['email', 'phone', 'mail'] }}`                                                              |
|             | `inline-check` | Provides a set of inlined checkbox components for selecting multiple options.<br /> `argTypes: { contact: { control: 'inline-check', options: ['email', 'phone', 'mail'] }}`                                               |
|             | `select`       | Provides a drop-down list component to handle single value selection. `argTypes: { age: { control: 'select', options: [20, 30, 40, 50] }}`                                                                                |
|             | `multi-select` | Provides a drop-down list that allows multiple selected values. `argTypes: { countries: { control: 'multi-select', options: ['USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico'] }}`                                                               |
| **string**  | `text`         | Provides a freeform text input. <br /> `argTypes: { label: { control: 'text' }}`                                                                                                                                           |
|             | `color`        | Provides a color picker component to handle color values.<br /> Can be additionally configured to include a set of color presets.<br /> `argTypes: { color: { control: { type: 'color', presetColors: ['red', 'green']} }}` |

### Parameters

Controls supports the following configuration [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.md), either globally or on a per-story basis:

#### Show full documentation for each property

Since Controls is built on the same engine as Storybook Docs, it can also show property documentation alongside your controls using the expanded parameter (defaults to false). This means you embed a complete [`Controls`](../api/doc-block-controls.md) doc block in the controls panel. The description and default value rendering can be [customized](#fully-custom-args) like the doc block.

To enable expanded mode globally, add the following to [`.storybook/preview.js`](../configure/index.md#configure-story-rendering):

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-expanded-controls.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Here's what the resulting UI looks like:

![Controls addon expanded](./addon-controls-expanded.png)

#### Specify initial preset color swatches

For `color` controls, you can specify an array of `presetColors`, either on the `control` in `argTypes`, or as a parameter under the `controls` namespace:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-preview-parameters-color-swatches.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Color presets can be defined as an object with `color` and `title` or a simple CSS color string. These will then be available as swatches in the color picker. When you hover over the color swatch, you'll be able to see its title. It will default to the nearest CSS color name if none is specified.

#### Filtering controls

In specific cases, you may be required to display only a limited number of controls in the controls panel or all except a particular set.

To make this possible, you can use optional `include` and `exclude` configuration fields in the `controls` parameter, which you can define as an array of strings or a regular expression.

Consider the following story snippets:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-disable-controls-regex.md" usesCsf3 csf2Path="essentials/controls#snippet-component-story-disable-controls-regex" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

#### Sorting controls

By default, controls are unsorted and use whatever order the args data is processed in (`none`). Additionally, you can sort them alphabetically by the arg's name (`alpha`) or with the required args first (`requiredFirst`).

Consider the following snippet to force required args first:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-sort-controls.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Disable controls for specific properties

Aside from the features already documented here, Controls can also be disabled for individual properties.

Suppose you want to turn off Controls for a property called `foo` in a component's story. The following example illustrates how:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-disable-controls.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Resulting in the following change in Storybook UI:

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source src="addon-controls-disable-specific-prop-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

The previous example also removed the prop documentation from the table. In some cases, this is fine. However, sometimes you might want to render the prop documentation without a control. The following example illustrates how:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-disable-controls-alt.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<Callout variant="info" icon="ðŸ’¡">
  As with other Storybook properties, such as [decorators](../writing-stories/decorators.md), you can apply the same pattern at a story level for more granular cases.
</Callout>

### Conditional controls

In some cases, it's useful to be able to conditionally exclude a control based on the value of another control. Controls supports basic versions of these use cases with the `if`, which can take a simple query object to determine whether to include the control.

Consider a collection of "advanced" settings only visible when the user toggles an "advanced" toggle.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-conditional-controls-toggle.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Or consider a constraint where if the user sets one control value, it doesn't make sense for the user to be able to set another value.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="component-story-conditional-controls-mutual-exclusion.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

The query object must contain either an `arg` or `global` target:

| field  | type   | meaning                       |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| arg    | string | The ID of the arg to test.    |
| global | string | The ID of the global to test. |

It may also contain at most one of the following operators:

| operator | type    | meaning                                              |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| truthy   | boolean | Is the target value truthy?                          |
| exists   | boolean | Is the target value defined?                         |
| eq       | any     | Is the target value equal to the provided value?     |
| neq      | any     | Is the target value NOT equal to the provided value? |

If no operator is provided, that is equivalent to `{ truthy: true }`.

<IfRenderer renderer={[ 'angular', 'ember', 'web-components' ]}>
  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Controls are not automatically generated for my component

  If you're working with Angular, Ember, or Web Components, automatic argTypes and controls inference will not work out of the box and requires you to provide [additional configuration](#choosing-the-control-type) to allow Storybook to retrieve the necessary metadata and generate the needed argTypes and controls for your stories. However, if you need additional customization, you can always [define them manually](#fully-custom-args).

This addon contributes the following [parameters](../writing-stories/parameters.md) to Storybook, under the `controls` namespace:

#### `disable`

Type: `boolean`

Disable this addon's behavior. If you wish to disable this addon for the entire Storybook, you should do so when registering `addon-essentials`. See the [essential addon's docs](../essentials/index.md#disabling-addons) for more information.

This parameter is most useful to allow overriding at more specific levels. For example, if this parameter is set to `true` at the project level, it could then be re-enabled by setting it to `false` at the meta (component) or story level.

#### `exclude`

Type: `string[] | RegExp`

Specifies which properties to exclude from the Controls addon panel. Any properties whose names match the regex or are part of the array will be left out. See [usage example](#filtering-controls), above.

#### `expanded`

Type: `boolean`

Show the full documentation for each property in the Controls addon panel, including the description and default value. See [usage example](#show-full-documentation-for-each-property), above.

#### `include`

Type: `string[] | RegExp`

Specifies which properties to include in the Controls addon panel. Any properties whose names don't match the regex or are not part of the array will be left out. See [usage example](#filtering-controls), above.

#### `presetColors`

Type: `(string | { color: string; title?: string })[]`

Specify preset color swatches for the color picker control. The color value may be any valid CSS color. See [usage example](#specify-initial-preset-color-swatches), above.

#### `sort`

Type: `'none' | 'alpha' | 'requiredFirst'`

Default: `'none'`

Specifies how the controls are sorted.

* **none**: Unsorted, displayed in the same order the arg types are processed in
* **alpha**: Sorted alphabetically, by the arg type's name
* **requiredFirst**: Same as `alpha`, with any required arg types displayed first

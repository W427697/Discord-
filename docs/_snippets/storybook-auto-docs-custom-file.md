The options are hidden by default and revealed when a user interacts with an element. 

It shows the currently selected option in its default collapsed state.

In a select input where there are less than 3-4 items, consider using radio boxes, or radio inputs instead. 

### How to use?

To help users understand the options available in a select input, include a default option that is unselectable and acts as a label.

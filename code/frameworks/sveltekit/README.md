# Storybook for SvelteKit

See [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/8.0/get-started/sveltekit?renderer=svelte) for installation instructions, usage examples, APIs, and more.

## Acknowledgements

Integrating with SvelteKit would not have been possible if it weren't for the fantastic efforts by the Svelte core team - especially [Ben McCann](https://twitter.com/benjaminmccann) - to make integrations with the wider ecosystem possible.
A big thank you also goes out to [Paolo Ricciuti](https://twitter.com/PaoloRicciuti) for improving the mocking capabilities.
